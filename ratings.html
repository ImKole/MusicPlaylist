<h4>What Does My Rating Mean?</h4>
<ul> 
    <li>Rating's are a way to make your playlist experience more tailored for you!</li>
    <li>The higher the rating, the higher the song will show up on your playlist.</li>
    <li>A 1-Rating will still add your song, but it will appear lower down.</li>
    <li>A 5-Rating will add your song to the top of your playlist and will be the first to play when selected.</li>
    <li>Song's with the same ratings will appear near the same spot, but will change based off of how many times
    the song has been played.</li>
